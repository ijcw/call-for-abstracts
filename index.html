      <p class="lead"> Intersections of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Community Well-Being: Exploring the Future of Humanity is a special issue of the International Journal of Community Well-Being. The issue aims to help community organizers, academics, researchers, instructors, policy makers, business people, administrators, governmental and nongovernmental staff,  to understand the implications of AI for community well-being.  A secondary aim is for readers to gain insight, ideas, and resources to work on a future where AI contributes to community well-being, the good of humans, and the planet through community-based platforms.
      </p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence and its relation to community well-being is a new research area. Submissions should build upon existing research theories, but also broaden the theoretical settings of academic and popular understanding of the intercepts of AI and community well-being. Where theoretical settings and frameworks are missing, submissions should suggest such. Where they exist, submissions should analyze them, identify where more is needed, where the voids are, what is ignored, and what has been gained from the analysis.  For example, submissions can contemplate AI and community well-being in a systems approach and identify leverage points within systems and organizational structures. Moreover, submissions should include implications and recommendations for practitioners, when appropriate. The special issue addresses the following three questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p><b>What well-being frameworks do we need in order to guide the development, deployment and/or operations of AI-systems for the benefit of humanity? How do they allow for communities to participate?  What could the history of communities around the world teach us about AI?  What type of opportunities are there that AI could help us to benefit from and how? </b> Submissions may focus on the development of well-being frameworks that have been issued or are in development to guide AI for the benefit of humanity such as indicators, guidelines, practices, codes of conduct, standards, regulations, and their relevance to community well-being. Submission on this topic should focus on frameworks that are based on a wide definition of well-being, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Better Life Index, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Indicators, Eurostat Quality of Life (8+1) indicators, or United Kingdom Office of National Statistics National Indicators of National Well-Being.  Submissions can include analysis, assessment of and suggestions for the engagement and involvement of communities.  It should include an assessment of the impacts on community well-being. It is preferred that the article includes recommendations or examples for community organizers and members to use or follow for engagement in the development of the framework or frameworks.
      </p></li><li>
      <p><b>How can AI protect community well-being from threats (climate change, economic inequality, gender inequality, interference with the democratic process, mental illness, etc)?</b> Submissions should focus on specific threats. Submissions should include an assessment and implications of a particular threat to community well-being, humanity and the planet, and the means with what type of AI can aid or frustrate community well-being in the face of that threat. Submissions should analyse specific initiatives, programs, policies or other efforts underway to address threats to community or society, and an analysis of implications at the community level. It is preferred that the article includes recommendations or examples for community-based approaches to AI as a means to mitigate or protect community well-being from a threat.
      </p></li><li>
      <p><b>How is the use of AI in itself be threat to community well-being? What can a community do to mitigate, manage or negate the threat? Threats may include unemployment, income inequality, psychological well-being (e.g. sense of purpose), safety, human rights violations, etc. </b> Submissions should focus on specific threat or group of threats. Submissions should include an assessment and implications of threats to community well-being, humanity and the planet, and the research and initiatives that aim to address the challenges, and an analysis of implications at the community level. It is preferred that the article includes recommendations or examples for community-based approaches to mitigate or protect community well-being.
      </p></li>
      <p>
      Of particular note, the Journal of Community Well-Being defines community as <i>“communities of place and interest within geographic or societal spaces concerning social, economic, cultural/social, environmental or political conditions and impacts on societal and social well-being”</i> (see <a href="https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/wellbeing+&+quality-of-life/journal/42413">About this Journal</a>).
